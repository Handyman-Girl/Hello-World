# Hello-World
Small business owner that fixes anything from basements to roofs && everything in between. Set up your electronics, fix your leaky faucets, change your toilets wax ring, level squeaky doors, set up your backyard wedding, pick up your dry cleaning. When I say we do everything. I mean we do just about everything so it makes your life easier. Would you rather spend time with your family or friends on your day off then have to fix your leaking toilet or resurface your driveway or rechaulk your leaking shower, yard work, getting your pool ready to swim or ready for winter, paint the interior or exterior of your home, stage your home for increased resale $$ We even train dogs.  Well, that is why Handyman-Girl is here. We can do the job for you or Skype you through the entire process. Email us and we will get right back to you. Thanks, Debbie
